# BACKEND TEMPLATE 

I have started this template with the idea that it will serve to initialize the project quickly. The intention is to add branches with different configurations, to be able to choose depending on the type of project you want to work on.

## Introduction

In the Main branch, we start with node, express and typescript. 
I have also added libraries like dotenv and nodemon


## Features


## Requirements
To run the project, you need to have the following requirements installed:
- Node.js
- npm


## Installation
Follow these steps to install the project:
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ebroto7/TEMPLATE_BACK_node-express-TS.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd folder_name
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```sh
$ npm install -y
```

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps and commands:

1. Create a `.env.development` & `.env.production` file in the root of your project with the following content:
```sh
PORT=<PORT>
```
Additionally, for each branch, you can find an example of the .env file in the configuration folder named env.example. This file serves as a template for your configuration.

2. Run server
 ```sh
npm run dev
```

3. test your endponts (with postman or other)
